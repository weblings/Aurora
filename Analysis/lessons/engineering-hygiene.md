# Engineering hygiene

General software-design/build-tooling principles, each demonstrated via a real
issue hit in this repo. See [`README.md`](README.md) for how entries get routed
here vs. elsewhere.

## `enable_testing()` must be called in the parent scope, before `add_subdirectory()`, not inside the test subdirectory itself

CTest only wires a directory's `CTestTestfile.cmake` to descend into a
subdirectory's tests if testing was already enabled *before* that subdirectory
was added. Calling `enable_testing()` (via `include(CTest)`) inside
`tests/CMakeLists.txt` built the test binary fine, but `ctest --test-dir build`
reported "No tests were found!!!" — nothing told the top-level test file to
look inside `tests/` at all.

**Fix:** call `enable_testing()` in the parent `CMakeLists.txt`, immediately
before `add_subdirectory(tests)`, not inside the tests directory's own file.

## Don't build C++ on a Windows-mounted drive from inside WSL2

Configuring CMake against a repo living on `/mnt/c` or `/mnt/d` (DrvFs) hit
real `configure_file: Operation not permitted` errors during compiler
detection — DrvFs doesn't support the POSIX file semantics CMake's probing
needs, unlike a native Linux filesystem.

**Fix:** clone/build from WSL's own filesystem (e.g. `~/aurora`), not the
Windows-mounted path. Keep the Windows-side repo as the source of truth and
mirror changed files across, rather than building in place on `/mnt/*`.
